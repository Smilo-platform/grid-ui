## Grid UI

[![ethpkg status](http://api.ethpkg.org/badge/gh/ethereum/grid-ui)](http://ethpkg.org/gh/ethereum/grid-ui)

### What is Grid?

“Often referred to […] as “digital frontier", the Grid was made to provide an experimental platform where all forms of research could be carried out at unparalleled speeds.” - [Tron Movie](https://tron.fandom.com/wiki/Grid)

One way to describe Smilo Grid is a platform to run experiments, create prototypes (and hackathon projects) or develop fully working apps for the many available clients in the ecosystem.
Another description could be that Smilo Grid is the control center for all kinds of clients and Smilo core binaries.

With Grid, clients can be downloaded, configured, and started all in one place. But even more than this, Grid serves as an Smilo provider, which means that once a client is configured and started, DApps can connect to Grid and share the connection to the Smilo network.

It is ideal for people who want to run a full node, have a convenient and secure way to update their binaries, and don't want to rely on centralized 3rd party services.

Grid can host and launch other interfaces and the functionality can be extended and adjusted through apps and plugins.

### Contributing

There are many ways to get involved with this project. Get started [here](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Development

Clone, install dependencies, and start the application:

```
git clone https://github.com/Smilo-platform/grid-ui.git
cd grid-ui
yarn && yarn start
```

This will serve the application at `localhost:3080`, but little can be done without the [Grid](https://github.com/Smilo-platform/grid) electron wrapper:

```
git clone https://github.com/Smilo-platform/grid.git
cd grid
yarn && yarn start:dev
```
